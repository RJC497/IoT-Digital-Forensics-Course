# IoT-Digital-Forensics-Course

I have created an Internet of Things (IoT) Digital Forensics Course which includes several digital forensic images of IoT devices. The goals are to provide an overview and some hands-on analysis of common IoT digital forensics data. I have taught or co-taught this course to federal agents, other law enforcment personnel and digital forensics students. If you are interested in having this course taught at your organization, please contact me via LinkedIn - where I am listed as Jean Costello.  You can also contact my co-teacher who is on LinkedIn and a professor at UTSA - he is Oren Upton.

I dedicate this course to all Law Enforcement Personnel everywhere (and their civilian counterparts) â€“ past, present and yet to come. I admire, respect and appreciate the dedication of Law Enforcment Personnel and hope that this course can be of value to them.

I am honored to be a part of the cybersecurity and digital forensic community and this is my humble attempt to also add value to that community. 

The course is a takeoff of my 2017 Master's thesis wherein I flushed out the concepts, recommended a six-step digital forensic methodology and conducted labs to create data to learn more about IoT.

My thanks to the Technical Reviewer of this course - Douglas A. Orr, Ph.D., Asst. Dept. Head, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice, Univ. Of North Georgia.

Respectfully submitted,
R. Jean Costello
