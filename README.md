# 4 Free IoT-Digital-Forensics-Courses for US-based Law Enforcement - September and October 2025 with registration details

I originally created one Internet of Things (IoT) Digital Forensics Course (Course 1) which includes several digital forensic images of IoT devices. The goals of the course are provide an overview and some hands-on analysis of common IoT digital forensics data. I have taught or co-taught this course to federal agents, other law enforcment personnel and digital forensics students. 

I dedicated that course to all Law Enforcement Personnel everywhere (and their civilian counterparts) – past, present and yet to come. I admire, respect and appreciate the dedication of Law Enforcment Personnel and hope that this course can be of value to them. I am honored to be a part of the cybersecurity and digital forensic community and this is my humble attempt to also add value to that community. The course is a takeoff of my 2017 Master's thesis wherein I flushed out the concepts, recommended a six-step digital forensic methodology and conducted labs to create data to learn more about IoT. My thanks to the Technical Reviewer of this course - Douglas A. Orr, Ph.D., Asst. Dept. Head, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice, Univ. Of North Georgia. 

Respectfully submitted,

Parts of the original Course 1 became outdated - so it was removed from this respository. However, I have since partnered with UTSA and Boston University and we have expanded and updated Course 1 and built out 3 other courses. If you are a US-based law enforcment personnel and are interested in taking these courses please read the details below and contact Erin Stephens to register.
